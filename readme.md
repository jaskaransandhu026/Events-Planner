### Event Planner Application
This project actually contains two modules:
- A React.js application (the frontend Multi-Page SPA)
- A backend REST API to which the React app communicates with (send + fetch data)

You must run "npm install" in both project folders.

Thereafter, you can start the backend REST API with "npm start" (inside the "backend-api" folder).
The React app dev server is then also started via "npm start" (though inside the "react-frontend" folder).

You MUST have both servers (backend + frontend) up and running for the project to work.
